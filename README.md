# Rproj-undergrad

A new continuous probability distribution which enhances and extends the Fisk distribution by employing the Alpha power transformation, the Beta transformation and the
transformed transformer (T-X) technique is proposed and studied. To a significant degree,
the new distribution is very flexible in analyzing positive data in hydrology, biostatistics
and economics. Various structural properties of the new distribution are derived, including explicit expressions for the moments, characteristics function, survival function, hazard
function and quantile function. The flexibility of the new density function is illustrated
by means of an application to a real finance dataset and the new distributions are finally
compared and weighed to obtain the best alternative distribution to model real finance
data.

This application was originally created to serve as an interactive interface for researchers to model, examine, and study the properties of Fisk distributions and its extensions.
